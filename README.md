# 8-Bit_Processor
 Implementation of a simple 8-bit processor using verilog

The main code simulates the operation of a basic 8-bit processor using verilog HDL.
The code has to be run in ModelSim Software.
The testbench creates a 8x16bit memory to help with load and store operations.
The testbench also contains simple instructions directly converted to machin code.
The instruction set is explained below.
